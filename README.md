# GIT Commit

This repository demonstrates the commit message style guide which is suggested by Udacity.  

## Message Structure

The layout of commit messages is shown as below. It consists of three distinct parts separated by a blank line. The title, an optional body and optional footer.  
```txt
type: subject

body

footer
```

## Type

Please choose the most appropriate type for the commit message.
- feat: a new feature
- fix: a bug fix
- docs: changes to documentation
- style: formatting, missing semi semi colons. etc; no code change
- refactor: refactoring production code
- test: adding tests, refactoring test; no production code change
- chore: updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc; no production code change

## Subject

Subject is a short title similar to a news title short, simple and conclusive. Note that imperative tone is preferred. Usually, not more than 50 characters.  

## Body

Body is an optional part of the commit as it is only needed when your commit messages requires a little more explanation and context. The body should explain `what` and `why`, not `how`.  

## Footer

Footer is optional and is used to reference issue tracker IDs.
